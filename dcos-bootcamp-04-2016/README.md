# DCOS bootcamp

## Contents

Training session at Mesosphere HQ on 2016-04-14.

First you want to install the DCOS CLI and clone this repo in the directory where you've installed the CLI. For example, I've installed the CLI into `~/sandbox/dcos/ccm/dcos` hence I would do the following:

    $ pwd
    /Users/mhausenblas/sandbox/dcos/ccm/dcos
    $ git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/training.git

Going forward, we will call the directory you've installed the DCOS CLI in simply `$DCOS_HOME`. Now check if you can access the DCOS Dashboard and you're all set:

The hands on sessions are:

1. [Containers &amp; Docker](docker/)
1. [Mesos, Marathon and DCOS](dcos/)
1. CI/CD
1. Big Data
